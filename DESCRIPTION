Description: The main objective of cooperative games is to allocate a good among
  the agents involved. This package includes the most well-known   allocation 
  rules, i.e., the Shapley value, the Banzhaf value, the egalitarian rule, and 
  the equal surplus division value. In addition, it considers the point of view 
  of a priori unions (situations in which agents can form coalitions). For this
  purpose, the package includes the Owen value, the Banzhaf-Owen value, and the
  corresponding extensions of the egalitarian rules. All these values can be 
  calculated exactly or estimated by sampling.
