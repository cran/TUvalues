Description: The main objective of cooperative Transferable-Utility games (TU-games) 
  is to allocate a good among the agents involved. The package implements major 
  solution concepts including the Shapley value, Banzhaf value, and egalitarian
  rules, alongside their extensions for structured games: 
  the Owen value and Banzhaf-Owen value for games with a priori unions, and the
  Myerson value for communication games on networks. To address the inherent exponential 
  computational complexity of exact evaluation, the package offers both exact 
  algorithms and linear approximation methods based on sampling, enabling the 
  analysis of large-scale games. Additionally, it supports core set-based 
  solutions, allowing computation of the vertices and the centroid of the core.
